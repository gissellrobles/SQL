--For this SQL project I queried a database named "chinook"
--This database represents digital media store including 
--tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

--The Chinook sample database includes:
--11 tables
--A variety of indexes, primary and foreign key constraints
--Over 15,000 rows of data

--Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

--1 Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, c.CustomerId, c.Country
FROM customers c
WHERE c.Country <> 'USA';

--2 Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, c.CustomerId, c.Country
FROM customers c
WHERE c.Country = 'Brazil';

-- 3 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.invoiceid, i.invoicedate, i.billingcountry
FROM invoices i
LEFT JOIN customers c
WHERE i.billingcountry = 'Brazil';

--4 Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT firstname, lastname, title
FROM employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

-- 5 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT distinct billingcountry
FROM invoices;

-- 6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT i.invoiceid, e.firstname as 'Sales Agent First Name', e.lastname as 'Sales Agent Last Name'
FROM customers c
JOIN invoices i
ON i.customerid = c.customerid
JOIN employees e
ON e.employeeid = c.supportrepid
GROUP BY i.invoiceid
ORDER BY i.invoiceid asc;

-- 7 Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT i.invoiceid, i.total, 
c.firstname as 'Customer First Name', c.lastname as 'Customer Last Name', c.country,
e.firstname as 'Sales Agent First Name', e.lastname as 'Sales Agent Last Name'
FROM employees e
JOIN invoices i
JOIN customers c
WHERE e.employeeid = c.supportrepid
GROUP BY i.invoiceid;

-- 8 How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT count(invoiceid) as 'Total Invoices in 2009'
FROM invoices
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

-- 9 What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(total) AS '2009 total sales'
FROM invoices
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

--10 Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT ii.invoicelineid, t.name as 'Track Name'
FROM invoice_items ii
JOIN tracks t
ON ii.trackid = t.trackid
ORDER BY ii.invoicelineid;

--11 Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT  ii.invoicelineid, t.name as 'track name' , ar.name as 'artist name'
FROM invoice_items ii
LEFT JOIN tracks t
ON ii.trackid = t.trackid
INNER JOIN albums al
ON t.albumid = al.albumid
LEFT JOIN artists ar
ON ar.artistid = al.artistid
ORDER BY ii.invoicelineid;

--12 Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.name as 'track name', al.title as 'album name', mt.name as 'media type', g.name as 'genre'
FROM tracks t
JOIN albums al
ON t.albumid = al.albumid
JOIN media_types mt
ON t.mediatypeid = mt.mediatypeid
JOIN genres g
ON t.genreid = g.genreid;

--13 Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT e.firstname , e.lastname, 
ROUND(SUM(i.total),2) AS 'total sales'
FROM employees e
JOIN customers c
ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid
JOIN invoices i
ON c.customerid = i.customerid
WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.firstname;


--14 Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.firstname , e.lastname, 
ROUND(SUM(i.total),2) AS 'total sales'
FROM employees e
JOIN customers c
ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid
JOIN invoices i
ON c.customerid = i.customerid
WHERE i.invoicedate LIKE '2009%'
AND e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.firstname
ORDER BY 'total sales' desc
LIMIT 1;
